# Loop
    1)For            -Typically, we Use when we know how much iteration we want-
          for(initilization expr; condition expr; update){
                  ------------------//body
                  }
    2)While Loop     -Typically, we use when we don't know how much iteration we want--
                while(condition){
                         --------
                         --------  }
    3) Do-While Loop

                      --------    Body executed at least Once.          
                      ---------   Exit controlled loop 
                    }while(condition);
